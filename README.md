# search-discord-data
Searches the discord messages given to you after you download your data from discord.

Follow [this link](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004027692-Requesting-a-Copy-of-your-Data) to find out how to download your discord data. After that just put the python script in the same directory as all the other folders (messages, programs, account, etc...) and run the script!
